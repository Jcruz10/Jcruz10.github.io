      <p> I found this site to be quite intriging.  I like the set up and the overall composition of the site.  I like the fonts that were used for the title and how they have the title on one side and all the images to the left.  I found in interesting how on the bottom of the page you are able to click on a pair of sunglasses and a different image would pop up.</p>

<p> This website dynamic is very interesting.  I like how it mostly consists with images.  I like how some of the icons are constantly moving while others are still.  This website setup is very interesting.</p>

      <p> I found this website to be colorful and fun to look at!  I like how this website has all of the illustration designs randomly places and you are able to scroll around and click on any work of your choosing. </p>
